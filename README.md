# 👋 Hello there

## I'm Lorenzo

I'm a Backend Engineer at **Bipa**, where I ship code that backs a bank and secures people's money. Bipa is Brazil's first Bitcoin bank and one of the first in the world to integrate with the Lightning Network. 

I'm also a developer advocate at **Vinteum**, where I teach developers how Bitcoin and other freedom tech works and how they can leverage these technologies to build cool shit. 

I did some years of electrical engineering and computer science, dropped out of both tho. I like to understand how things work, but I hate bureaucracy.
